Windows 8.1 starts here, Windows 7 starts below

To setup the USB BDM on Windows 8.1:

Copy the "USB_BDM" folder to the desktop.

Press the "Win + C" keyboard combination to bring up the Charms Bar, then click on the Settings Charm. 

Click on the "Change PC settings" link.

Then click on the "Update and Recovery" option on the left hand side.

Click on the "Recovery" option on the left hand side.

Once selected, you will see an "Advanced startup" section appear on the right hand side. You will need to click on the “Restart now” button.

Once your Computer has rebooted you will need to choose the "Troubleshoot" option.

Click "Advanced options" 

Then "Startup Settings".

Since we are modifying boot time configuration settings, you will need to restart your computer one last time.

Finally, you will be given a list of startup settings that you can change. The one we are looking for is “Disable driver signature enforcement”. To choose the setting, you will need to press the 7 key.

The computer will now restart into Windows an you can begin installing the driver.



Windows 7 begins here, Windows 8.1 continues here.



Run the "USBDM_4_10_6_105_Win" from the desktop, 

Next go to device manager, right click "unknown device",

Choose to manually install the drivers,

Browse to the "drivers" folder on the desktop and click "ok",

This should start the install.  You should now have BDM drivers installed.

Open Code Warrior 5.1

Select “MC9S12XDP512” and “TBDML”  

Good to go!
